Write a quick summary of the project here Dan :)

## Folder Structure

## Running the program locally

* Open a cmd prompt or use the one inside visual studio code.
* Change directory to the one in which these files sit - i.e. the same directory in which 'index.html' can be found.
* Type 'http-server' into the command line.
* Click on the URL that http-server writes to the command line - your local testing version of the code is available here.
* Add '/index.html' to the end of the URL before visiting it, as such: http://192.168.68.122:8080/index.html.

## Deploy the project to its final location
